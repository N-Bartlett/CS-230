<Bold>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</Bold>

Gaming room is a 3rd party company that hired us to do a design document to port their game from its platform onto, iPhone and Andriod.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The thing I did best was to answer the client questions consisely. Being straight to the point about the pros/cons of each platform for their application makes the document easier to read and does not waste the clients time with unnecessarily long sections


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document kept me on track with what actually needed implimentation. Developing features that are not required would have used much more time than was needed to fulfill their requirements.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I revisit the choice for which language should be used to develop the software. Java made the most sense as a choice at the time but with some more research there may be a better option to improve application performace especially on mobile devices. Choosing a language that would result in a less resource intensive application would provide a better game to the customer. The reason I chose Java initially is because cost was a factor in the customers consideration and refactoring their entire existing game into a new language would increase the cost.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Considering the user's needs when designing is the most important of this process. If you do not consider what the customers requirements are not only will you fail to provide the product they are looking for, you will have wasted their time and money. In the real world this could lead to a lawsuit and would most certainly lead to them leaving a negative review of the company I am working for or myself directly if I am working alone. This causes potential future clients to look elsewhere.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to this design software was to read and fully understand the customer requirements. For future software applications it would be important to have open communication with the customer to ensure everything is as they want it. In this case I was given perameters to work within but without an actual physical customer to communcate with there is no two way talk to ensure that all requirements are met. If cost was the lowest concern on the customers requirements it would have resulted in a different design altogether. Knowing customer priorities and the order of those priorities translates directly into what the final design document will look like and in this case I did not have the order of those priorities.
